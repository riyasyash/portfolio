I am a polyglot engineer with hands on experience in the designing and development of various web applications and micro services. I started my career at 'Sahaj Software Solutions' after completing the Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Government Engineering College of Palakkad in 2016.

I have worked with different programming languages and frameworks like Python, Go, Nodejs, Java, Ruby on Rails,Flask, Django, Angular and React. I have also tried my hand at Automation and DevOps with tools and technologies like Terraform, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes and Openshift. I prefer to work on interesting problems irrespective of the programming language being used.
 
I prefer to work on interesting problems irrespective of the programming language being used. 
I strongly believe, every problem can be solved if we concentrate on the "why" part of it, rather than the "how" part of it.

The realisation that we won't live long enough to, make all the mistakes ourselves has motivated me, to learn from the mistakes of others along with mine.

While AFK, I prefer to travel with my camera in search of fantastic places and frames.
