title: "DIY- Setup a Simple Private Cloud"
description: "Like every other novice photographer, I like to carry my DSLR with me on all trips and I end up taking a lot of pictures and videos. To share this content with everyone who accompanied me on the trips, I have to organize it into folders and share each of them with only the interested parties. This was getting harder to do using Google Drive because of the storage limits and untracked publicly accessible links"
