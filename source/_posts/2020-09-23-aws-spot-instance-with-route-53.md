title: "AWS Spot Instances with Route 53"
description: "Route 53 is a very useful service from AWS. It allows you to route traffic to a variety of resources like Loadbalancers and static IP addresses. Using Route 53 with a NLB/ALB is pretty straightforward. When it comes to single instance workloads, it is simpler to create route 53 entries directly to the instance's public IP address. "
